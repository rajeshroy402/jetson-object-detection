##Hi guyz, firstly I wanna thanks Nvidia DLI for awesome support with this program!

Let's see my work in the objection detection part now:
Firstly, kindly run the docker container as instructed [here](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-inference/blob/master/docs/aux-docker.md) and then navigate to the folder python/examples/ 

You may now run my python script by following the below commands:

###simply launch it from a terminal with the Python interpreter:
``` 
$ python3 my-detection.py
```

There's also a video showing the working of it:
